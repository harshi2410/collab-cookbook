# Tandoori Chaap (Vegetarian)
- **Cuisine:** Indian
- **Author:** @harshi2410
- **Ingredients:**
  - 4 pieces soy chaap (frozen or fresh, thawed if frozen)
  - 1/2 cup yogurt (or dairy-free yogurt for vegan option)
  - 1 tbsp tandoori masala
  - 1 tsp ginger-garlic paste
  - 1/2 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)
  - 1 tsp lemon juice
  - Salt to taste
  - 1 tbsp oil (for grilling or baking)
- **Steps:**
  1. If using frozen soy chaap, boil in water for 5–7 minutes until soft, then drain and pat dry.
  2. In a bowl, mix yogurt, tandoori masala, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, lemon juice, salt, and oil.
  3. Add the soy chaap pieces and coat well. Marinate for at least 1 hour (or up to 4 hours for deeper flavor).
  4. Preheat oven to 200°C (390°F). Place chaap on a greased tray.
  5. Bake for 20–25 minutes, turning halfway, until slightly charred and aromatic.
     - Alternatively, grill on a stovetop tawa or barbecue for a smoky flavor.
  6. Garnish with lemon wedges and serve hot with sliced onions and mint chutney.
- **Cooking Time:** 1 hr 30 mins (including marination and prep)
